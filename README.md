**Code:**
We have included Jupyter notebooks containing Python code for running and analyzing the gene expression, multi-omics, and non-invasive classifiers for radiation response. We have also included the gene sets and code used to compare the significant gene list from our gene expression classifier to those from the RadiationGeneSigDB database.
